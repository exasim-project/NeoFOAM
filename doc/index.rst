Welcome to NeoFOAM!
===================================

The NeoFOAM project has set itself the goal of bringing modern software development methods to the core libraries of OpenFOAM. 
By reimplementing the `libfiniteVolume` and `libOpenFOAM` we want to deliver a code that:

* is compliant with modern C++20;
* is extensively unit-tested;
* is plattform portable and GPU ready;
* is highly extensible via Plugins 

We aim for a high level of interoperability with OpenFOAM, however, if reasonable, NeoFOAM might deviate from the OpenFOAM API. NeoFOAM is a community driven project and we welcome contributions by everyone.

Compatability with OpenFOAM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are aimining for a high level of compatability with OpenFOAM. However, we don't expect binary or ABI compatability. This means you NeoFOAM won't produce a `libfiniteVolume.so` and `libOpenFOAM.so` which could serve as a plugin replacement of existing `libfiniteVolume.so` and `libOpenFOAM.so`. Instead we aim for source compatability, i.e. the posibility to compile application OpenFOAM code like pimpleFoam  and others against the NeoFOAM libraries.   

Building OpenFoam Applications with NeoFOAM 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, the support for building applications is very limited. The simplest way to build applications 
with the NeoFOAM core is by adopting the CMake build procedure showcased in our `applications <https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoFOAM/tree/main/applications>`_
folder. For now, we only have a `minimal <https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoFOAM/tree/main/applications/solver/minimal_>`_ example as we are still working on the basic implementations. But 
we will gradually add example applications as we move along. Most likely we will initially work on porting solver applications, since pre- and postprocessing tools that work on a file level basis are trivially interoperable.
