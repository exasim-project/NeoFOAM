Welcome to NeoFOAM!
===================

The NeoFOAM project has set itself the goal of bringing modern software development methods to the core libraries of OpenFOAM.
By reimplementing the `libfiniteVolume` and `libOpenFOAM` we want to deliver a code that:

* is compliant with modern C++20;
* is extensively unit-tested;
* is platform portable and GPU ready;
* is highly extensible via Plugins

We aim for a high level of interoperability with OpenFOAM, however, if reasonable, NeoFOAM might deviate from the OpenFOAM API.
NeoFOAM is a community-driven project and we welcome contributions from everyone.

Compatibility with OpenFOAM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are aiming for a high level of compatibility with OpenFOAM.
However, we don't expect binary or ABI compatibility.
This means that NeoFOAM won't produce a `libfiniteVolume.so` and `libOpenFOAM.so` which could serve as a plugin replacement for existing `libfiniteVolume.so` and `libOpenFOAM.so`.
Instead, we aim for source compatibility, i.e. the possibility to compile application OpenFOAM code like pimpleFoam and others against the NeoFOAM libraries.
This approach is demonstrated in the `FoamAdapter <https://github.com/exasim-project/FoamAdapter>`_ repository.
