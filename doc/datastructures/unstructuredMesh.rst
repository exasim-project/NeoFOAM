UnstructuredMesh
================

The `unstructuredMesh` holds the relevant data for the representing a computational grid on the selected executor.
It is comparable to OpenFOAMs `fvMesh` class.
However, since currently no construction from disc is supported, it is mainly used a data container for mesh data.

.. warning::
   - Currently no method to read meshes from disc is implemented. Thus
     mesh data needs to be provided by the user or a converter such as FoamAdapter needs do be used.

BoundaryMesh
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The boundaryMesh in the current implementation stores the relevant data for the `boundaryMesh` on the selected executor.
So it is currently a data container for boundary mesh data.
The `boundaryMesh` information are stored in a continuous array and the index for the boundary patch is stored in a offset.

.. warning::
   - unable to read the boundary mesh from disc
   - boundary mesh data needs to be provided by the user
