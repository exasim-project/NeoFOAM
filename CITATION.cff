abstract: '<p>The NeoFOAM team is proud to announce the first release of NeoFOAM,
  a next generation implementation of a CFD core. NeoFOAM leverages the features of
  modern C++ to implement core routines to efficiently solve PDEs required by CFD
  frameworks like OpenFOAM, thus NeoFOAM helps to catch up with the rapidly evolving
  HPC ecosystem.</p>

  <p>Our design goals are:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Platform portable for all CPU and GPU hardware vendors</li>

  <li>Modular design leveraging the existing simulation software ecosystem like Kokkos,
  sundials, PETSc, or Ginkgo</li>

  <li>Implement an updated domain specific language for DSL that allows to encode
  complex partial differential equations in a concise yet powerful form</li>

  <li>Simple adoption within OpenFOAM</li>

  <li>Target multiphysics simulations and enable simple integration of coupling software
  like preCICE</li>

  </ul>

  <p>This v.0.1 release is all about building a foundation for the future developments
  of NeoFOAM. It focuses on building the foundational library structure, a first draft
  of the DSL API including basic kernels, and a solid CI/CD infrastructure from the
  start. It features unit and integration testing on Linux, macOS, and Windows as
  well as sanitizer and static analyzer <a href="https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoFOAM/actions">workflows</a>.</p>

  <p>Integration into OpenFOAM applications are demonstrated in our <a href="https://github.com/exasim-project/FoamAdapter">FoamAdapter</a>
  repository. A full list of changes can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoFOAM/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG.md</a>.
  An exciting year is ahead of us, visit our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/exasim-project/projects/1/views/8">Roadmap</a>
  to find out which features are next. Thank you to everyone who <a href="https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoFOAM/blob/main/AUTHORS.md">contributed</a>
  to NeoFOAM.</p>'
