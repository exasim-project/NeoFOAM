## Requirements

NeoFOAM has the following requirements

*  _cmake > 3.22_
*  _gcc >= 10_ or  _clang >= 16_ 
*  _Kokkos 4.2.0_ (Preferably preinstalled, otherwise cloned and build at compile time) 

For NVIDIA GPU support
* cuda 

For building the documentation further dependencies like doxygen and sphinx are requirement. The list of requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoFOAM/actions/workflows/doc.yml)


## Compilation

[![Build NeoFOAM](https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoFOAM/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoFOAM/actions/workflows/build.yaml)
[![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitter-8A2BE2)](https://matrix.to/#/#NeoFOAM:gitter.im)

NeoFOAM uses cmake to build, thus the standard cmake procedure should work. From a build directory you can execute 

    cmake <DesiredBuildFlags> ..
    cmake --build .
    cmake --install .

Additionally, we provide several Cmake presets to set commmonly required flags if you compile NeoFoam in combination with Kokkos.

    cmake --list-presets # To list existing presets
    cmake --preset ninja-kokkos-cuda # To compile with ninja and common kokkos flags for CUDA devices

## Executing Benchmarks

NeoFOAM provides a set of benchmarks which can be executed and plotted by the following commands

    cmake --build . --target execute_benchmarks # runs the benchmark suite
    cmake --build . --target execute_execute_plot_benchmark # plots the benchmark results
