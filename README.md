# NeoN

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The NeoN project needs you!
> If you're interested in contributing to NeoN please open a PR! If you have any questions on where to start please contact us here or on [gitter](https://matrix.to/#/#NeoN:gitter.im).

## Requirements

NeoN has the following requirements

*  _cmake > 3.22_
*  _gcc >= 10_ or  _clang >= 16_
*  _Kokkos 4.3.0_

For NVIDIA GPU support
* cuda _12+_

For development it is required to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

### C++ dependencies

C++ dependencies like Kokkos are handled via [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) and are cloned at the configuration step.
However, the cmake build process will prefer system wide installed C++ dependencies like Kokkos, cxxopts, etc.
If you prefer to clone, configure and build dependencies your self consider setting `-DCPM_USE_LOCAL_PACKAGES = OFF`, see [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) for more details.

## Compilation

[![workflows/Build on linux](https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoN/actions/workflows/build_on_ubuntu.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoN/actions/workflows/build_on_ubuntu.yaml?query=branch%3Amain)
[![workflows/Build on OSX](https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoN/actions/workflows/build_on_macos.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoN/actions/workflows/build_on_macos.yaml?query=branch%3Amain)
[![workflows/Build on windows](https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoN/actions/workflows/build_on_windows.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoN/actions/workflows/build_on_windows.yaml?query=branch%3Amain)

NeoN uses cmake to build, thus the standard cmake procedure should work.
From a build directory you can execute

    cmake <DesiredBuildFlags> ..
    cmake --build .
    cmake --install .

Additionally, we provide several Cmake presets to set commmonly required flags if you compile NeoN in combination with Kokkos.

    cmake --list-presets # To list existing presets
    cmake --preset production # To configure for production use
    cmake --build --preset production # To compile for production use


### Executing Tests

We provide a set of unit tests which can be executed via ctest or

    cmake --build . --target test


## Integration with OpenFOAM

Currently, NeoN is not a standalone CFD Framework.
It is designed to be used within OpenFOAM.
Examples how to integrate NeoN into OpenFOAM and how to write applications is demonstrated in the [FoamAdapter](https://github.com/exasim-project/FoamAdapter) repository.

## Documentation

An online documentation can be found [here](https://exasim-project.com/NeoN/latest), be cautious since this repository is currently evolving the documentation might not always reflect the latest stage.
For building the documentation further dependencies like doxygen and sphinx are requirement.
The list of requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoN/actions/workflows/build_doc.yaml)
